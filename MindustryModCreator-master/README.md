# MindustryModCreator
Tool to create Mindustry mods

This is a work in progress.

## Installation
Try `git clone https://github.com/Paulao17/MindustryModCreator.git`

Alternatively download it as a zip and unzip the zip.

You can now find and open the `main.html` file.

## Usage
Requires a relatively modern browser to operate. You should enable javascript.

Usage at this time should be considerably intuitive.

## Roadmap
Importing and exporting should always be functional before added.

- [x] Mod metadata
- [WIP] Blocks
- [ ] Other types
- [ ] Github Imports
- [ ] Github Exports?
